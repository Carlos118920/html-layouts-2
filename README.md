html-layouts-2
==============

##Objectives
Understand HTML and its uses in layout by completing a series of tasks

##Directions
Just like html-layout the original, each folder contains an image you need to recreate using HTML and CSS -->

# Project Summary

In this project, you will be cloning/re-creating three different html-layouts from scratch. This will help you get used to creating html documents and linking css pages. This project will also help you practice the ability to create layouts using html and css.

## Setup

* Fork and clone this repo.
* `cd` into the directory.

## Directions

Inside each of the three folders you will find an image. That image is a representation of the layout you need to create using HTML and CSS. The 'first' folder contains an index.html and a style.css file. In the other folders, you'll need to add them yourself.

## First Folder



## Second

## Third
