html-layouts-2
==============

##Objectives
Understand HTML and its uses in layout by completing a series of tasks

##Directions
Just like html-layout the original, each folder contains an image you need to recreate using HTML and CSS -->

# Project Summary

In this project, you will be cloning/re-creating three different html-layouts from scratch. This will help you get used to creating html documents and linking css pages. This project will also help you practice the ability to create layouts using html and css.

## Setup

* Fork and clone this repo.
* `cd` into the directory.

## Directions

Inside each of the three folders you will find an image. That image is a representation of the layout you need to create using HTML and CSS. The 'first' folder contains an index.html and a style.css file. In the other folders, you'll need to add them yourself.

## First

### Directions

Below are the very broad directions to finishing the clone of the image in the 'first' folder. We encourage you to try to finish this project with as little help as possible. But if you need more guidance there is a 'Follow Along' section right below these directions that will be a little more in dept. Have Fun!

* Open 'first' folder.
* Create a reset.css file.
* Add reset css styles.
* Create an index.html file in the 'first' folder.
* Create a style.css file in the 'first' folder.
* Create your index.html boiler plate.
* Link your style.css in your index.html file.
* Create a HTML structure using semantic elements.
* Add CSS to give each element a height, width, position, etc. to make your webpage look as close as you can to the image provided.

### Follow Along

* Open `index.html`.
* Inside index.html, create your index.html boiler plate.
  * solution
* Inside index.html, link the index.html file to the style.css file.
  * solution
* Inside index.html, link the index.html file to the reset.css file.
  * solution
* Inside index.html, create a div that will act as the wrapper for all the content on the page. Give this element a class name and close the element. The rest of the elements will be put inside this div.
* Inside index.html, create a section and don't forget to close the section. Give the section element a class name to be able to style it later.
  * solution
* Inside index.html, inside the section you created in the previous step, create three div elements and give each one the same class name. Next give each of the divs another unique class to differentiate each by their background color. You can give a element more that one class by separating them by a space like this `class="firstClass secondClass"`.
  * solution
* Inside index.html, below the section you created, create a paragraph. Give it a class name and close the paragraph.
  * solution
* Inside index.html, create another paragraph tag and give it the same class name as the previous paragraph. Close the paragraph.
  * solution
* Inside index.html, below the paragraph's create a section. Give this section a class name and don't forget to close the section.
  * solution
* Inside index.html, inside the section you created in the previous step create two divs and give each a unique class name. Now reuse the class you used to differentiate the previous section's divs by background color to their corresponding div.
  * solution
* Inside index.html, create another section. Give this section a class name and close the section.
  * solution
* Inside index.html, inside the section you created in the previous step create two child divs and give each a different class name.
  * solution
* Inside index.html, reuse the class names you are using to differentiate divs by background color and give these two divs their corresponding class name.
  * solution
* Inside index.html, inside the second div you created inside the section, create another div and give it a class name, also give it a second class name that will differentiate it by background color.
  * solution
* Open style.css
* Inside style.css, select the div that is acting as the wrapper by class and give it some padding.
  * solution
* Inside style.css, select the first section by class and give it css properties that will make the child elements display side-by-side and evenly spread the children by the space between them. Hint: flex.
  * solution
* Inside style.css, in the same css block you used in the previous step add another css property that will keep space between the section and the elements below it.
* Inside style.css, select the three boxes at the top of the page by the class that is similar on all three and give them a height and a width.
  * solution
* Inside style.css, select the three elements separately by their unique class and give each block a css property that will change the background color.
  * Solution
* Inside style.css, select the text on the page by class and assign it properties that will make it look as close as you can to the image. For example size, font, margin, etc.
  * Solution
* Inside style.css, select the section(directly after the text) by class and give it a display property that will make its children elements display side-by-side. Next give it a margin to keep some space between it and the elements below it.
  * solution
* Inside style.css, select the div on the left side of the section we worked on in the previous step. Give it a height and a width.
  * solution
* Inside style.css, select the div on the right side of the same section we worked on in the previous step. Give it a height and a width.
  * solution
* Inside style.css, select the section at the bottom of the page. Give it a style that will make its children elements display side-by-side.
  * solution
* Inside style.css, select the blue box in the section from the previous step and give it a with and height.
  * solution
* Inside style.css, select the red box in the same section from the previous step and give it a height and width.
  * solution
* Inside style.css, select the black box in the same section from the previous step and give it a height, width and margin that will center it.
  * solution
* Great job! That looks really close the the original image. Let's keep going!

  * solution
* Inside index.html, inside the same section worked on in the previous step create a paragraph and give the same class name as the previous paragraph you created.
  * solution
* Inside index.html, outside the main section create a footer and give it a class name to be able to style it later.
  * solution
* Inside index.html, inside the footer create two anchor tags. The first anchor tag should display the text "Google" and have a href pointing to the Google homepage. The second should display the text "Apple" and have a href pointing to the Apple homepage. Give them both the same class name.

  * solution
* Inside style.css, select the second section by class and give it a background color, padding, and a margin to keep space between it and the elements below it.
  * solution
* Inside style.css, select the image by class and give it a width and margin to keep space between it and the elements below it. NOTE: We do not have to assign the image a height because the default value of height is `auto`. This will make the image stay proportional.
  * solution
* Inside style.css, select the footer by class and give it a height, width, background color, and padding.
  * solution
* Inside style.css, select the anchors in the footer by class and give them a font color, font size, font-family, line height, and margin. Take of the default text decoration on the links and give them a property to make them move to the right side of the page.
